# Favicon Setup Guide

## How to Add Your Custom Favicon

1. **Prepare your PNG file:**
   - Create or obtain your desired favicon image
   - Recommended size: 32x32 pixels or 64x64 pixels
   - Format: PNG (for best quality and transparency support)

2. **Replace the placeholder:**
   - Delete the current `frontend/public/favicon.png` file
   - Copy your PNG file to `frontend/public/favicon.png`
   - Make sure the filename is exactly `favicon.png`

3. **The favicon is already configured:**
   - `index.html` is already set to reference `/favicon.png`
   - No additional code changes needed

## File Structure
```
frontend/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.png  ← Your PNG file goes here
└── src/
    └── index.html   ← Already configured to use favicon.png
```

## Notes
- The favicon will automatically appear in browser tabs
- Clear your browser cache if you don't see the new favicon immediately
- The favicon is also used for bookmarks and browser history
